In order to effectively solve a problem - it is best to have a set up that works regaardless of if the problem changes.
How do you go about solving problems? 
Below is an effective technique that I have used for years.


 POLYA'S PROBLEM SOLVING TECHNIQUE
1. What is the problem? What is the question asking you to do?
2. Make a plan to solve it / satisfy requirements
3. Implement the plan 
4. Go back & check. If need be: Revise / Refactor
